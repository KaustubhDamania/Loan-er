Contributing Guidelines
----------------------------

> We appreciate all valuable contributions - bug reports, documentation and design enhancements issues as well as Pull Requests to make the app more convenient, functional and bug free.

> To begin contributing have a look at the open issues.

> To install this locally on your computer, clone the repository and then run the following commands: 
```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python run.py
```
> You can also run ngrok in the background to make the local url public.

> Feel free to open an issue (and work on it too), if you have an idea that would make it better than it already is. However, it would be better to get the thumbs up from a maintainer first because we wouldn't want your work to go in vain.
