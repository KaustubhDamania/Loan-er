> The current procedure for registering for an Unsecured Personal Loan for Aditya Birla Capital is to fill out a form on their website which is very boring.

> So here comes Loan-er, a PWA chatbot which would make this process interactive for the user.

> Also the user shouldn't be bound by the language they use to chat with Loan-er so Loan-er can also talk in Hindi! ðŸ¤©

> One can add support for multiple languages by contributing towards improving Loan-er.

- The OTP feature doesn't work as of now, hence the OTP is hardcoded as 4151.
